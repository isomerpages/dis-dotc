<p>We are currently at the exciting mid-way point of Hackathon 2024! This
event has brought together dedicated teams focused on developing prototypes
aimed at gaining valuable insights into the challenges faced by our users
and developers alike.</p>
<p>Our talented developers are seizing this opportunity to delve into various
technologies, experiment with different approaches, and even assume new
roles within their teams. In an industry that is constantly evolving, continuous
learning and professional growth are essential. This Hackathon has proven
to be a dynamic environment that encourages innovation and the exploration
of fresh ideas.</p>
<p>A highlight of the event was the visit from Senior Minister of State for
Defence Heng Chee How, who took the time to review our progress. His presence
was not only an honour; it also served to motivate our teams. He emphasised
the importance of ongoing innovation and urged participants to continue
pushing the boundaries of digitalisation within the Singapore Armed Forces
(SAF) and the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The atmosphere at the Hackathon is charged with creativity and enthusiasm
as teams work diligently toward their goals. Each prototype being developed
is a step forward in understanding and addressing the needs of users within
the defence landscape, ensuring that solutions are both practical and user-centric.</p>
<p>For a closer look at how collaboration fuels our work, check out the highlights
