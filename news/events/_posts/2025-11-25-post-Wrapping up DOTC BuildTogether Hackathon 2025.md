<br>It's a wrap on the DOTC BuildTogether Hackathon 2025!
<br>
<br>Over the past two weeks, users and developers from across the SAF came
together with one goal, to build solutions that truly make a difference.
From bouncing around ideas to experimenting with new tech and refining
prototypes, our teams showed what happens when empowered developers meet
engaged users. The energy, the creativity, and the willingness to problem-solve
together made this year’s Hackathon something special.
<br>
<br>Demo Day brought all that hard work to life. Whether it was a simple tool
that solved a real pain point or a bold concept pushing new possibilities,
every prototype showed heart, purpose, and the drive to create smarter,
faster, and more resilient digital capabilities for our defence community.
<br>
<br>Here’s to the people behind the innovation, the teamwork, the curiosity,
and the spirit of building the future of defence tech together.</p>
