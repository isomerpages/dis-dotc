<p>
<br>Building on the success of the inaugural Hackathon 2024, BuildTogether
Hackathon 2025 promises to deliver even more digital solutions for the
Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). Last year’s event brought together users
and developers across the SAF, emphasising the motto: "For the SAF, by
the SAF." This year, we aim to continue this collaboration, tackling new
challenges and advancing innovation even further.</p>
<p><strong><u>Building on 2024's Success</u></strong>
<br>In 2024, 40 developers tackled 9 problem spaces across 4 services, driven
by a single purpose: leveraging technology to deliver impact to the SAF.
The hackathon reinforced the belief that the quality of software is closely
tied to the quality of interactions between developers and stakeholders.
Participants from diverse backgrounds include active personnel, dedicated
NSmen who are seasoned software engineers, interns, and NSFs from the RSAF
Agile <em>innovation </em>Department (RA<em>i</em>D).</p>
<p><strong><u>What's New in 2025?</u></strong>
<br>Our upcoming hackathon builds on these lessons, setting the stage for
more complex projects. This year’s event will bring together participants
from entities such as the Naval Ops Dept (NOD), Joint Training Dept (JTD),
Singapore Maritime Crisis Centre (SMCC), Joint Intelligence Command (JIC),
SAF C4 and Digitalisation Command's C4 Ops Group (C4OG), RA<em>i</em>D,
and the SAF Space Development Office, to identify real-world challenges
and prototype impactful solutions.</p>
<p><strong><u>Examples of Challenges Submitted&nbsp;</u></strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Streamlined Processes for the Organisation of Meetings</em></strong>
<br>Secretariats shoulder a significant administrative workload, from collating
item registrations, retrieval of past minutes, as well as filing and distribution
of meeting materials. A solution could be developed to streamline the end-to-end
process for such tasks on the SAF’s non internet-facing Ops Support IT
systems.</p>
<p></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><em>Scenario Generator for Training</em></strong>
<br>An interactive real-time scenario generator could produce dynamic situations
to support training. This allows personnel to hone their decision-making
in response to uncertain operational scenarios.</p>
</li>
</ul>

the highlights and innovative solutions showcased during the event.</p>
