<p>Exercise Wallaby is the Singapore Armed Forces' largest overseas training
exercise, held annually at the vast Shoalwater Bay Training Area in Queensland,
Australia. It brings together thousands of personnel and hundreds of platforms
across the Army, Air Force, and Digital &amp; Intelligence Service to conduct
large-scale, integrated operations that cannot be replicated in Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For the first time, SAFC4DC forward deployed a team of DOTC software engineers
and a UI/UX designer to Exercise Wallaby. Embedded alongside intelligence
analysts, the team collaborated closely to refine and enhance in-house
software based on live operational feedback. This direct exposure to the
exercise environment allowed them to better understand user workflows and
operational demands, leading to more intuitive and mission-relevant solutions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Forward deployed software engineer ME5 Bryan Lien reflected on his experience
participating in the exercise: <em>“By working in the field, the team was able to implement and release new software features during the actual conduct of the exercise — shortening development cycles and delivering immediate improvements to users. This agile approach not only boosted operational efficiency on the ground but also demonstrated the strength of close ops-tech integration in supporting real-time mission outcomes.”</em>
