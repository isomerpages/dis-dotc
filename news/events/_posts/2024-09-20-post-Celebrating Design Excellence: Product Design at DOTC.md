<p>Effective software design is crucial for creating intuitive and impactful
products, especially as the stakes grow higher. High-quality design not
only demonstrates excellence but also ensures that user needs are at the
forefront.</p>
<p>At the Digital and Intelligence Service (DIS), designers collaborate closely
with engineers and product managers to develop a comprehensive understanding
of user requirements, which facilitates data-driven decisions throughout
the development cycle.</p>
<p>The recent Product Design talk organised by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/singaporeproductdesign/" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Singapore Product Design</a> in
collaboration with Digital Ops-Tech Centre (DOTC), gathered a vibrant group
of design professionals eager to explore the unique intersection of UX
and the military.</p>
<p>Joel Tai, Senior Product Designer DOTC, offered valuable insights on adapting
commercial UX principles for military contexts, providing real-world examples
that resonated with both seasoned designers and those new to the field.
Trena Lee, a product designer at DOTC, led discussions on how traditional
design principles evolve to tackle the unique challenges posed by security-driven
projects, highlighting the differences and similarities between commercial
and military domains. Trena Lee’s journey from communications to UX design
inspired many, while Joel Tai’s mentorship showcased the importance of
nurturing the next generation of designers.</p>
<p>A highlight of the event was the engagement with emerging designers interested
in the complexities of military UX design. The discussions emphasised the
necessity of understanding these challenges and provided practical strategies
for addressing them. Attendees also connected with designers from the Ministry
of Defence (MINDEF) and Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) community,
exchanging insights about their experiences and the growing importance
of user experience (UX) in national defence.</p>
<p>As DIS continues to prioritise design excellence, the collaboration and
creativity fostered during this talk will serve as a foundation for innovations
that address our nation’s critical defence requirements. Together, these
conversations reinforced the fundamental role of effective design in enhancing
military capabilities.</p>
