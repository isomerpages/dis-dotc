where he was presented with live demonstrations of our in-house digital
products, developed to support MINDEF and the SAF’s evolving operational
and training needs.</p>

<p>We also shared our software development approach, which involves working
in close partnership with operational users to get their continuous feedback.
This iterative process plays a vital role in shaping the design, features,
and overall operational usefulness of each product.</p>

<p>During the visit, Defence Minister engaged with DOTC personnel, including
our Operationally-Ready National Servicemen (NSmen) who are software engineers
by profession. These NSmen joined the DIS under the Enhanced Expertise
Deployment Scheme (EEDS) which allows NSmen with specialised civilian skills
to take on roles with the DIS. Our NSmen brings along with them a wealth
of software engineering experience, working closely with us to develop
critical software for SAF’s operations.</p>
