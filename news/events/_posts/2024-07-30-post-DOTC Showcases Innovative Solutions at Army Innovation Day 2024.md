<p>On the 2nd of November, the Department of Technology and Communications
(DOTC) participated in the Army Innovation Day 2024 (AID 24), organized
by the Combat Service Support Command (CSSCOM) at Kranji Camp III. This
year's theme, “Innovation for Scale,” highlighted the importance of deploying
innovations as operational capabilities within the Army and encouraged
personnel to scale innovation as we collectively “Reimagine our Everyday.”</p>
<p>During AID 24, DOTC showcased two innovative products: Pinpoint and Pressify.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.pinpoint.gov.sg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Pinpoint</a> is
a secure AI-assisted media sharing and collaboration platform designed
for government users. We demonstrated how Pinpoint enhances operational
efficiency by enabling Army personnel to quickly locate, share, and collaborate
on critical media in real time, fostering effective communication and coordination
among units.</p>
<p><a href="https://app.pressify.gov.sg/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Pressify</a> is
a digital publishing tool that empowers users to create visually appealing
documents and presentations effortlessly. At the event, we showcased how
Pressify streamlines the creation of reports and briefs, allowing Army
personnel to present their ideas clearly and professionally. This tool
saves valuable time while enhancing overall output quality, ensuring vital
information is communicated effectively.</p>
<p>AID 24 featured over 30 innovative projects focused on improving operations,
training, and administrative functions. The event also included the Game
Changers Pitch Challenge, where nine teams pitched ideas with significant
potential impacts on</p>
<p>Army operations. Five pre-selected teams competed for funding support
from the Chief of Army (COA) to scale their projects. Major-General (MG)
David Neo recognized the creativity and ingenuity of individuals and teams
who contributed to the Army over the past year, emphasising the commitment
to innovation and adaptability.</p>
<p>The team at DOTC is proud to contribute valuable tools that empower Army
personnel to work more efficiently and effectively. We remain committed
to supporting the Army's mission through continuous improvement and the
adoption of technological advancements.</p>
<p>Together, let us embrace the future of innovation as we transform challenges
into opportunities and shape the capabilities of our Army!</p>
