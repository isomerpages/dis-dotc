<p>The Digital Ops-Tech Centre (DOTC) team embarked on an insightful retreat
to Sembawang Air Base, located within Chong Pang Camp. This excursion provided
a rare opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of the Republic of Singapore
Air Force (RSAF) and its critical role in safeguarding the nation’s airspace.</p>
<h3>Setting the Stage: Reflection and Vision</h3>
<p>Before delving into the activities at the air base, the team gathered
for a self-actualisation exercise led by Howard Hung, Head of Corporate
Services. He encouraged everyone to reflect on and list three key goals,
values, or aspects of DOTC that they wished to cherish, preserve, or pursue.
This exercise set a thoughtful tone for the retreat, reminding the team
of their shared purpose and commitment to excellence.</p>

<p>Following this, James Kwek, Head of DOTC, addressed the team, reinforcing
DOTC's vision, mission, and values. He spoke about DOTC’s pivotal role
in driving digital transformation within the defence sector and how innovation,
collaboration, and adaptability are essential to achieving their goals.
His words served as a guiding framework for the rest of the retreat, inspiring
the team to draw parallels between DOTC’s objectives and the operational
excellence observed at RSAF.</p>

<h3>Immersive Experience at the Control Tower</h3>
<p>A highlight of the visit was the exclusive access to the air base's control
tower. From this vantage point, the team observed firsthand the precision
and coordination required for air traffic management. RSAF personnel shared
insights into their rigorous protocols, showcasing the seamless integration
of technology and human expertise in ensuring the safety and efficiency
of air operations.</p>
<p>Vijey Ng, software engineer at DOTC, shared his experience of visiting
the control tower:</p>

<p><em>"Visiting a control tower for the first time was an exciting experience. It was impressive to see the team operating like a well-oiled machine. While there were many lessons to take away from this short visit, what stood out most to me was how they had digitalised their processes. Previously, they used a physical whiteboard with movable magnets to track operations. Now, they’ve transitioned to a touchscreen interface where icons can be slid around seamlessly. This upgrade introduced features like real-time synchronisation across multiple boards and automatic warnings when things were out of place. It was enlightening to see how much the user experience could be improved while still maintaining a familiar workflow."</em>
</p>
<p>Eunice Lee, product manager at DOTC, reflected on the broader operational
insights gained:</p>
<p><em>"It was a fascinating experience visiting the camp, and eye-opening to learn how so many different squadrons come together to support one mission. I gleaned insights on the difficulties and risks of certain tasks, and gained a lot of respect for the honourable men involved in keeping our air space safe every single day. Being able to visit the control tower allowed me to link what was shared with the actual operations."</em>
</p>
<h3>Understanding RSAF Operations</h3>
<p>Beyond the control tower, the team gained an appreciation for the complexity
of managing a high-readiness air base, with RSAF officers explaining the
importance of continuous learning and adaptability. They emphasised the
role of cutting-edge simulation platforms in enhancing operational readiness.</p>

</p>
<p>Sembawang Air Base remains a key operational hub for RSAF fighter squadrons,
providing 24/7 air defence coverage and surveillance. It is home to various
aircraft, including the formidable F-15SG and F-16 fighter jets, and serves
as a premier training ground for pilots, maintenance crews, and other RSAF
personnel.

<h3>Experiencing SAF Life at Chong Pang Camp</h3>
<p>To fully immerse themselves in the SAF experience, the team had lunch
at Chong Pang Camp. This provided a glimpse into the daily life of SAF
personnel, allowing the team to experience firsthand the camaraderie and
structured environment that define military life. Sharing a meal in the
camp setting reinforced the sense of unity and discipline that underpins
RSAF operations.</p>

<h3>Reflections on the Experience</h3>
<p>This retreat not only deepened the team's appreciation for RSAF’s commitment
to national security but also highlighted valuable lessons in precision,
teamwork, and innovation. Observing the seamless collaboration between
technology and personnel reinforced the importance of efficiency and adaptability
- core values that align with DOTC’s mission.</p>
<p>As DOTC continues to drive digital transformation in the defence sector,
experiences like this retreat serve as a reminder of the critical role
that teamwork and a shared sense of purpose play in achieving operational
excellence.</p>
