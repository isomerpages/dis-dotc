<p>At DOTC, every product and feature we build is a team effort, driven by
collaboration, problem-solving, and a shared commitment to innovation.
In this series, we highlight the people behind our work, showcasing their
unique perspectives and experiences in shaping our projects.</p>
<p>We spoke with <strong>Eunice Lee</strong>, <strong>Product Manager</strong> in
the Pinpoint team, about the art of balancing timelines, teams, and goals.
From navigating last-minute chaos to fostering collaboration, Eunice shares
insights into what makes product management both challenging and rewarding.
Much like tackling a challenging bouldering route, product management requires
assessing risks, planning the next move, and adapting when the unexpected
happens.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>How do you manage timelines, teams, and goals to keep everything running
smoothly?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>"Planning ahead is key! As a PM, I’m the bridge between leadership and the product team, so I make it a point to check in with both regularly—aligning on strategy, tackling tactical tasks, and clearing roadblocks. I also recognize that unexpected challenges are inevitable, so I encourage the team to build in buffer time for deadlines. This way, we maintain a sustainable pace while delivering high-quality features.</em>
</p>
<p><em>Most importantly, I remind myself that I don’t have to have all the answers. Leaning on my team for different perspectives not only strengthens decision-making but also fosters collaboration and trust."</em>

<blockquote>
<p>If you could change one thing about the product development process, what
would it be?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>"I’d love to see more designers learning frontend development! The designer I work with has taken the initiative to pick up some coding skills, and it’s been a game-changer. She can quickly visualize changes, make simple UI edits, and collaborate even more effectively with developers. This not only boosts productivity but also strengthens the connection between design and development."</em>

<blockquote>
<p>What’s the most unexpected moment that made you say, ‘This is why I love
being a Product Manager?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>"One moment that really stuck with me was early in my time here. The team wasn’t feeling confident about an upcoming feature, but we were already set to start building it. I decided to call for an impromptu brainstorming session, rallying everyone to take a step back and reassess the problem.</em>
</p>
<p><em>What happened next was amazing—we came up with a completely new design that better met users’ needs, and when we finally shipped it, the feedback was fantastic! Knowing that I helped create an environment where the team felt empowered to challenge assumptions and build something better was immensely satisfying and made me realize how much I love this role."</em>

<p>What’s your superpower: keeping teams on track or calming last-minute
chaos?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>"Both are essential skills for any PM, but if I had to pick one, I’d say handling last-minute chaos! I thrive in high-pressure situations by taking a logical, structured approach—gathering all the details, making sense of the mess, and then breaking it down into manageable steps. It’s rewarding to bring clarity and direction when everything feels like it’s spiraling out of control."</em>

<p>What’s your strategy for dealing with a meeting overload day?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>"I actually pack my schedule even more—by starting my day earlier! It might sound counterintuitive, but I always make plans to visit a great coffee spot before diving into work. It gives me something to look forward to and helps me mentally gear up for the day ahead. This little ritual works wonders for my mood and energy levels as I am a food-motivated human."</em>

<p>Based on your experience at DOTC so far, what has been the most memorable
moment for you?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>"One standout moment has to be when I shared my experience at DOTC with the ProductTank community for PMs. I was so nervous leading up to it, but once I started speaking, I got into a flow where it felt like a conversation with the audience, and I actually enjoyed it! Afterwards, several attendees came up to share their thoughts, offer compliments, and even ask for advice.</em>
</p>
<p><em>It was surreal—I’d always been an attendee at these events and never imagined I’d be the one on stage, giving a talk and helping others in their careers. That experience made me feel incredibly grateful for my time at DOTC and reaffirmed just how much I’ve grown here."</em>

<blockquote>
<p>With your passion for bouldering, you’re no stranger to assessing risks
- knowing when to make a bold move and when to play it safe. Similarly,
in product management, balancing innovation with risk is key. How do you
navigate this in your role?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>"Rather than jumping in headfirst out of excitement, I always take the time to assess the situation. I speak to multiple users to weigh the pros and cons, including the impact of a potential change, and conduct usability testing when relevant. (In bouldering, this is like reading the route, identifying key holds, and assessing the success of certain betas against your strengths.)</em>
</p>
<p><em>The best results don’t come from always sticking to the well-worn approach. If, after thorough exploration, there’s no clear answer—I say take the leap of faith, just like trusting a sketchy foothold or going for a big move when the top hold is just within reach. If it doesn’t work out, you simply brush off the chalk, reassess, and try again."</em>
