<br>The DOTC team swapped their usual workspace for an adrenaline-filled afternoon
at The Cage @ Kallang, where they geared up for some friendly competition
through a series of high-energy laser tag matches.
<br>
<br>Unlike the typical workday, the air was buzzing with excitement as colleagues
faced off each other in strategic gameplay, laughter, and light-hearted
rivalry.</p>

<p>The game sessions encouraged collaboration, quick thinking, and camaraderie
— skills that are applicable to our everyday work. Whether dodging “enemy
fire” or cheering from the sidelines, the team brought the same energy
and spirit that drove DOTC forward.
<br>
<br>As the last round wrapped up, everyone walked away with tired legs, big
smiles, and a stronger bond as one DOTC family.</p>
