<p>At DOTC, innovation is more than just a buzzword—it’s a way of life. We
sat down with Foo Chi Fa, a software engineer whose journey has taken him
from computer vision research to Open Government Products (OGP), and finally,
to DOTC. With a passion for building, breaking, and improving things, Foo
shares his experiences, insights, and the occasional lighthearted take
on the realities of engineering.</p>
<p>Foo Chi Fa graduated from the National University of Singapore (NUS) in
2022 with a degree in Computer Science. His early career focused on developing
computer vision technologies before he transitioned to OGP. Now at DOTC,
he continues to push the boundaries of what’s possible in the tech space,
bringing innovative solutions to real-world challenges.</p>

<p>What’s the most exciting feature you’ve ever built, and what made it special?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>"The Christmas &amp; New Year special on Pinpoint! I added snowfall and fireworks to the app—it was a fun way to make our product feel festive and engaging. Plus, it’s not every day you get to bring a little holiday magic into a government tool!"</em>

<p>If you could streamline one task in your work to improve efficiency, what
would it be and why?</p>

<p>What’s the best advice you’d give someone aspiring to be a software engineer?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>"Do pointless things. Build fun, seemingly ‘useless’ projects—it keeps you motivated, helps you learn new things, and sometimes, those pointless ideas turn into something truly valuable."</em>
