<h4><strong>Inside DOTC: A Conversation with Foo Chi Fa, Software Engineer</strong><br></h4>

<p>We sat down with Foo Chi Fa, a software engineer whose journey has taken
him from computer vision research to Open Government Products (OGP), and
finally, to DOTC. With a passion for building, breaking, and improving
things, Foo shares his experiences, insights, and the occasional lighthearted
take on the realities of engineering.</p>
<p>Foo Chi Fa’s journey into software engineering wasn’t straightforward.
Initially studying business in polytechnic, he found its emphasis on soft
skills unfulfilling. Wanting to develop technical expertise, he pivoted
to Computer Science at NUS, where his passion for programming flourished.</p>
<p>Before his degree, Foo aspired to work in the public sector, believing
it to be more meaningful than profit-driven enterprises. He signed on with
military intelligence, leveraging data science for analytical operations.
However, he soon realized that military intelligence was only tangentially
related to software engineering and AI.</p>
<p>After completing his degree, Foo transitioned to C4X to focus on software
engineering, where his passion for coding took center stage. From OGP,
where he absorbed best engineering practices under Jean’s mentorship, he
moved to DOTC, bringing back these practices and contributing to Pinpoint’s
development.

<p>What’s the most exciting feature you’ve ever built, and what made it special?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>"The Christmas &amp; New Year special on Pinpoint! I added snowfall and fireworks to the app—it was a fun way to make our product feel festive and engaging. The feature was a simple Easter egg—a CSS animation triggered by hovering over the Pinpoint logo in the gallery. It was a small touch, but seeing people discover it was incredibly rewarding."</em>

<blockquote>
<p>If you could streamline one task in your work to improve efficiency, what
would it be and why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"On-call duties. Every live product needs an on-call engineer, who serves
as the first line of defense against app issues, service outages, and security
vulnerabilities. It’s an important but mentally taxing role. A lot of incidents
happen due to new releases introducing bugs or adjacent services facing
issues that impact our app.</p>
<p>AI could potentially help by understanding our codebase and architecture,
suggesting likely causes of incidents. A simple rollback button would also
be great, as many bugs come from recent updates—being able to revert quickly
would make life much easier."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>What’s the most memorable moment from your time at DOTC so far?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Definitely the Hackathon. It was my first time using the T3 stack with
Next.js and Tailwind CSS, and deploying to Vercel. The improvements in
open-source tech for rapid prototyping were eye-opening.</p>
<p>The problem space was well-defined with motivated users, making development
feel focused and fast-paced—it kept our cadence high and the experience
fun. Plus, I got to experiment with creative features like a snake game
using paper planes instead of a snake and a Telegram chatbot that provides
inspiring quotes, paired with an AI that critiques them from the perspective
of a Singapore government software engineer."

<blockquote>
<p>What’s the best advice you’d give someone aspiring to be a software engineer?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Do pointless things. Build fun, seemingly ‘useless’ projects—it keeps
you motivated and helps you learn new things. Some of my ‘pointless’ projects
include adding snowfall/fireworks to Pinpoint that helped me appreciate
event handling and CSS animations as well as an AI quote reviewer on Telegram
which taught me prompt engineering and integrating LLMs for real-time interactions.</p>
<p>The best way to grow as an engineer is to experiment and tinker without
worrying about utility!"</p>
