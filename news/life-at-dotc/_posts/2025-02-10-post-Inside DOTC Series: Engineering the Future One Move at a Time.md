<p>At DOTC, continuous learning and improvement drive meaningful change.
This series showcases team members and their stories, highlighting their
expertise and contributions in shaping our work.</p>
<p>We spoke with <strong>Foo Chi Fa</strong>, <strong>software engineer</strong> in
the Pinpoint team, about his journey from computer vision research to OGP
(Open Goverment Products) and finally DOTC. Passionate about building,
breaking, and improving systems, he shares his experiences, insights, and
the occasional lighthearted take on engineering.
<br>
<br>Chi Fa initially pursued business but sought technical expertise, leading
him to Computer Science at NUS. Passionate about public service, he joined
military intelligence, applying data science before realising his true
interest lay in software engineering. After graduating, he transitioned
to C4X, refined his skills at OGP, and brought best practices to DOTC,
contributing to Pinpoint’s development.

<p>What’s the most exciting feature you’ve ever built, and what made it special?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>"One of the most exciting features I’ve worked on was building a waiting room using Cloudflare Workers on FormSG to support National Day event balloting. It was crucial in ensuring the product could handle sudden surges of 10,000 to 200,000 active users while maintaining smooth performance. You can read more about it </em>

</p>
<p><em>That said, since this falls outside of DOTC, another feature I’ve worked on is reverse image and semantic search in Pinpoint, leveraging an image-text multimodal foundational model. This allows users to search their workspaces using either an image or semantic text, with the model mapping inputs to a latent space for comparison between images or between text and images. It’s designed to assist in quickly retrieving relevant images. However, it’s still in the prototype phase and hasn’t been rolled out to users yet."</em>

<p>If you could streamline one task in your work to improve efficiency, what
would it be and why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>"On-call duties. Every live product needs an on-call engineer, who serves as the first line of defense against app issues, service outages, and security vulnerabilities. It’s an important but mentally taxing role. A lot of incidents happen due to new releases introducing bugs or adjacent services facing issues that impact our app.</em>
</p>
<p><em>AI could potentially help by understanding our codebase and architecture, suggesting likely causes of incidents. A simple rollback button would also be great, as many bugs come from recent updates - being able to revert quickly would make life much easier."</em>

<p>When faced with a tricky bug, what’s your go-to move: coffee, a walk,
or sheer determination?</p>

<p>What’s the most memorable moment from your time at DOTC so far?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>"Definitely the Hackathon. It was my first time using the T3 stack with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, and deploying to Vercel. The improvements in open-source tech for rapid prototyping were eye-opening.</em>
</p>
<p><em>The problem space was well-defined with motivated users, making development feel focused and fast-paced - it kept our cadence high and the experience fun. Plus, I got to experiment with creative features like a snake game using paper planes instead of a snake and a Telegram chatbot that provides inspiring quotes, paired with an AI that critiques them from the perspective of a Singapore government software engineer." </em>

<p>What’s the best advice you’d give someone aspiring to be a software engineer?</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>"Do pointless things. Build fun, seemingly ‘useless’ projects - it keeps you motivated and helps you learn new things. Some of my ‘pointless’ projects include adding snowfall/fireworks to Pinpoint that helped me appreciate event handling and CSS animations as well as an AI quote reviewer on Telegram which taught me prompt engineering and integrating LLMs for real-time interactions.</em>
</p>
<p><em>The best way to grow as an engineer is to experiment and tinker without worrying about utility!"</em>
