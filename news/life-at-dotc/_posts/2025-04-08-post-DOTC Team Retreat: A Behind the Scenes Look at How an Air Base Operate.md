<p>The Digital Ops-Tech Centre (DOTC) team embarked on an insightful retreat
to Sembawang Air Base. This event provided a rare opportunity for the team
to gain a deeper understanding of the Republic of Singapore Air Force (RSAF)
and its critical role in safeguarding the nation’s airspace.</p>
<h3><strong>Setting the Stage: Reflection and Vision</strong></h3>
<p>Before delving into the activities at the air base, the team gathered
for a self-actualisation exercise led by Howard Hung, Head of Corporate
Services. He encouraged everyone to reflect on their key values and relate
those values to aspects of DOTC that they wished to preserve or pursue.
This exercise set a thoughtful tone for the retreat, reminding the team
of their shared purpose and commitment to national defence and excellence.</p>
<p>Following this, James Kwek, Head of DOTC, addressed the team, reinforcing
DOTC's vision, mission, and values. He spoke about DOTC’s pivotal role
in driving digital transformation within the SAF and discussed with the
team on the key focus areas for DOTC in the year ahead.</p>

<h3><strong>Immersive Experience at the Control Tower</strong></h3>
<p>A highlight of the visit was the visit to the air base's control tower
to learn more about the RSAF’s operations. From this vantage point, the
team observed firsthand the precision and coordination required for air
traffic management within a military aerodrome. RSAF personnel shared insights
into their operational processes and rigorous protocols, showcasing the
close integration of technology and human expertise in ensuring the safety
and efficiency of flying operations.</p>
<p>Vijey Ng, software engineer at DOTC, shared his experience of visiting
the control tower:</p>
<p><em>"Visiting a control tower for the first time was an exciting experience. It was impressive to see the team operating like a well-oiled machine. While there were many lessons to take away from this short visit, what stood out most to me was how they had digitalised their processes. Previously, they used a physical whiteboard with movable magnets to track operations. Now, they’ve transitioned to a touchscreen interface where icons can be slid around seamlessly. This upgrade introduced features like real-time synchronisation across multiple boards and automatic warnings when things were out of place. It was enlightening to see how much the user experience could be improved while still maintaining a familiar workflow."</em>
</p>
<p>Eunice Lee, product manager at DOTC, reflected on the broader operational
insights gained:</p>
<p><em>"It was a fascinating experience visiting the airbase, and eye-opening to learn how so many different squadrons come together to support one mission. I gleaned insights on the difficulties and risks of certain tasks, and gained a lot of respect for the honourable men involved in keeping our air space safe every single day. Being able to visit the control tower allowed me to link what was shared at the briefing with the actual operations."</em>
</p>
<h3><strong>Understanding RSAF Operations</strong></h3>
<p>Beyond the control tower, the team gained an appreciation for the complexity
of managing a high-readiness air base, with RSAF officers explaining the
importance of continuous learning and adaptability.</p>
<h3><strong>Experiencing SAF Life at Chong Pang Camp</strong></h3>
<p>To fully immerse themselves in the SAF experience, the team also had lunch
at the air base’s cookhouse. This provided a glimpse into the daily life
of RSAF personnel, allowing the team to experience firsthand the camaraderie
and environment that define military life.</p>

<h3><strong>Reflections on the Experience</strong></h3>
<p>This retreat not only deepened the team's appreciation of the role the
RSAF plays in national security, but also allowed the team to observe first
hand how technology can be closely integrated into operations to enhance
operational efficiency and safety.</p>
<p>As DOTC continues to drive digital transformation in the SAF, experiences
like this allow our team to have a more in-depth understanding of SAF operations,
which will help them develop better products for operational users.</p>
