<p>The month-long hackathon organised by the Digital Ops-Tech Centre (DOTC)
brought together talents from diverse backgrounds, inviting product designers
from the private sector, who are interested in Singapore’s defence space.
Designers like Geetha, Kenneth, and Elyn harnessed creativity, collaboration,
and innovation to deliver solutions addressing critical operational needs.</p>
<p>We had an insightful conversation with them to find out more about their
experiences which underscored the value of design thinking and teamwork
in achieving impactful outcomes in defence technology.

</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Inspiration and Problem Solving</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What inspired you to participate in the Hackathon, and what problem were you aiming to solve?</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Kenneth:</strong> "I was drawn by my interest in defence tech and
the chance to develop solutions for spectrum management. I wanted to help
stakeholders build a dashboard and explore new opportunities within this
space."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Geetha:</strong> "The ability to explore new ideas and collaborate
with people within MINDEF inspired me. My goal was to automate the manual
process of frequency assignment and improve visibility for frequency allocations."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Elyn:</strong> "As someone outside the field, this was a rare opportunity
to tackle problems in MINDEF's defence space. It also allowed me to apply
UI/UX design skills to solve issues with tracking HR workflows, which currently
lack efficiency and transparency."</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Collaboration and Teamwork</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>How did collaboration contribute to the development of your project?</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Geetha:</strong> "Daily stand-ups were essential for refining our
designs and moving forward. My team members brought extensive SAF domain
knowledge, which was crucial during user discussions."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Kenneth:</strong> "I doubled as a project manager, working closely
with engineers to develop a proof of concept. Workshops helped us shape
the product direction effectively."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Elyn:</strong> "Our team’s diverse backgrounds—from engineering
to design—brought unique perspectives. Evaluating ideas collectively improved
the product creatively, practically, and for the end-users."</p>
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Innovative Approaches and Technologies</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What innovative approaches or technologies did you integrate?</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Kenneth:</strong> "We visualised complex data through a spectrogram
and used workshops to gather user input. This iterative process ensured
the dashboard met user needs."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Geetha:</strong> "We adopted a design thinking approach to streamline
the frequency assignment process, combining automation with a user-friendly
interface."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Elyn:</strong> "We iterated on UI designs inspired by workflow
management tools, simplifying processes to make them intuitive and accessible
for all users."</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Impact on SAF and Innovation</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>How do you envision your project benefiting SAF and contributing to innovation?</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Geetha:</strong> "Automating frequency management saves SAF personnel
time, enabling them to focus on strategic tasks."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Kenneth:</strong> "Our dashboard enhances data visualisation, empowering
SAF and other government agencies to make informed decisions efficiently."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Elyn:</strong> "A streamlined platform for workflow tracking and
communication boosts accountability and can be applied across various SAF
processes, not just HR."</p>
</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Overcoming Challenges</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them?</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Geetha:</strong> "Understanding user requirements, especially for
the auto-assignment logic, was challenging. Feedback loops and prioritising
simplicity helped us address these issues."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Kenneth:</strong> "Visualising complex data and working with stakeholders
without clear answers were tough. Close collaboration and iteration were
key to overcoming these challenges."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Elyn:</strong> "We struggled with balancing scope and feasibility.
Creating a high-fidelity prototype alongside our functional demo allowed
us to showcase the product’s full potential."</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Key Learnings and Advice</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>What did you learn, and what advice would you give to future hackathon participants?</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Geetha:</strong> "I learned the value of diverse perspectives and
open communication. Listening to different viewpoints helped me grow as
a designer, collaborator, and communicator."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Kenneth:</strong> "The best solutions emerge from iterative feedback
and close collaboration with stakeholders. Future participants should stay
open-minded, fail fast, and learn quickly."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Elyn:</strong> "Embrace the process. Don’t worry about perfection;
focus on learning, experimenting, and stepping out of your comfort zone."</p>
</li>
