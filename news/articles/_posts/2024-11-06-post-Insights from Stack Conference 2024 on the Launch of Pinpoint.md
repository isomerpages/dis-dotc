<p>At the recent GovTech #StackConference2024, Chi Fa Foo, software engineer
at Digital Ops-Tech Centre (DOTC) discussed how his team engaged closely
with users from the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF), Ministry of Defence (MINDEF),
and Whole of Government (WOG) agencies to tackle a significant media management
issue facing the public sector.</p>
<p>In March 2024, they launched Pinpoint, a secure cloud-based digital media
platform specifically tailored for Singapore's public servants. This innovative
tool streamlines the storage, search, and collaboration processes related
to digital assets, incorporating user-driven features that cater to the
needs of government employees.</p>
<p>Chi Fa emphasised the critical importance of intentional feature design
in achieving collaborative goals. A key example he highlighted was the
implementation of role-based access control, which was informed by user
feedback signalling its intuitiveness. Recognizing that roles within organisations
can be dynamic and change over time, the team chose a flexible access control
system rather than a rigid framework for defining roles and permissions
from the outset. This approach was designed to remain user-friendly while
providing scalability and ease of maintenance for developers.</p>
<p>While this method may require greater initial effort, it is essential
for developing a product that meets users’ needs and adapts to their behaviours—fully
embodying the principles of responsible development.</p>
<p>The broader goal of digitalisation is to enhance quality of life and increase
productivity by leveraging advanced technology through thoughtfully designed
products and exceptional user experiences. At DOTC, we believe that digitalisation
strengthens connections among individuals and agencies, streamlining collaboration
in today’s teamwork-centric environment where effective cooperation tools
are paramount.</p>
