<p>Effective communication is the backbone of a well-functioning organisation.
In today’s fast-paced environment, teams need to stay updated quickly and
efficiently. Recognising this critical need, the Digital Ops-Tech Centre
(DOTC) collaborated with the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) to develop
Telepost — an innovative platform designed to modernise internal messaging
and enhance organisational connectivity.</p>
<p>Known as RSNPost within the RSN internal community, Telepost offers a
comprehensive solution that delivers targeted, personalised messages at
scale with ease. Developed entirely in-house through a successful <a href="https://www.dotc.gov.sg/showcasing-hackathon-teams-progress/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Hackathon</a> initiative,
Telepost streamlines communication by enabling broadcasts, one-to-one messaging,
and real-time monitoring — all through an intuitive, user-friendly dashboard.</p>
<h3>Key Features of Telepost</h3>
