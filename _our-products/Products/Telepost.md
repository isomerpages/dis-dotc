<p>Effective communication is the backbone of a well-functioning organisation.
In today’s fast-paced environment, teams need to stay updated quickly and
efficiently. Recognising this critical need, the Digital Ops-Tech Centre
(DOTC) collaborated with the Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN) to develop
Telepost — an innovative platform designed to modernise internal messaging
and enhance organisational connectivity.</p>
<p>Affectionately known as RSNPost within the RSN internal community, Telepost
offers a comprehensive solution that delivers targeted, personalised messages
at scale with ease. Developed entirely in-house through a successful Hackathon
initiative, Telepost streamlines communication by enabling broadcasts,
one-to-one messaging, and real-time monitoring — all through an intuitive,
user-friendly dashboard.</p>
