<p>In today's fast-paced digital landscape, managing an ever-growing volume
of images and videos has become increasingly challenging. Storage limits
and disjointed systems lead to siloed repositories and scattered files,
complicating storage and retrieval. Locating specific files demands significant
time, while unregulated sharing raises security and compliance risks. These
challenges call for a solution that simplifies media organisation and enhances
collaboration. Enter Pinpoint—an innovative, in-house solution tailored
to meet these needs.</p>

of digital assets among government users. Moving beyond traditional folders,
it uses flexible tagging to help users label and find media efficiently,
without reliance on specific file names or complex structures. With its
robust features, Pinpoint transforms how public officers manage digital
media.</p>
