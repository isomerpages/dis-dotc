<h2>Optimise Your Digital Media Management with Pinpoint</h2><a class="isomer-image-wrapper" href="https://app.pinpoint.gov.sg/"><img style="width: 90%;" height="auto" width="100%" alt="" src="/images/PinpointBlack_Horizontal_4x.png"></a>
<p>In today's fast-paced digital landscape, managing an ever-growing volume
of images and videos has become increasingly challenging. Storage limits
and the lack of a unified system result in siloed repositories and scattered
files, making storage and retrieval complex. This fragmentation not only
makes locating specific files time-consuming but also heightens security
and compliance risks due to unregulated sharing. These challenges call
for a solution that simplifies media organisation and enhances collaboration.
Enter Pinpoint—an innovative, in-house solution tailored to meet these
needs.</p>
<p>Pinpoint is a one-stop platform for public officers to store, search,
and share images and videos. Moving beyond traditional folder-based systems,
it uses tagging to let users flexibly label and locate media, eliminating
reliance on specific file names or rigid structures. With robust and customisable
features, Pinpoint aims to revolutionise media management by simplifying
workflows and boosting efficiency.</p>
<h4>Key Features of Pinpoint</h4>
