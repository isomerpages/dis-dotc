# Welcome to the Digital Ops-Tech Centre, also known as DOTC.

We are part of the fourth Service of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) â€“ the Digital and Intelligence Service (DIS).

From meeting new operational requirements on the digital frontier to developing a digital core well-versed in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, DOTC brings the fast-paced digital landscape to the forefront of military operations. 

We cultivate our very own digital experts, through the the C4X(Digital) and Digital Specialist (DigiSpec) schemes. They are provided the right tools, environment, and mentorship for innovation and collaboration, to create products that aid the operations of SAF's operational units.

As the centre of excellence for SAF's digital expertise, DOTC partners the Defence Tech Community (DTC), Whole-of-Government digital agencies, academia and the industry, to remain innovative in its approaches and culture. Those with us are given opportunities for rotation between the DOTC and the SAF's operational units, and externally to DOTC's professional partners for exposure to build a comprehensive understanding of the cyber ecosystem.

## Our Mission

At DOTC, we want to revolutionise the way the military operates by harnessing the power of cutting-edge technology, and human-centric solutions.
