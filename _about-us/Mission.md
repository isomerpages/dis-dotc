The mission of Ministry of Defence and the Singapore Armed Forces is to enhance Singapore's peace and security through deterrence and diplomacy, and should these fail, to secure a swift and decisive victory over the aggressor.

The Digital Ops-Tech Centre (DOTC) will support the SAF in its mission by raising an responsive and capable software workforce that will engineer digital products that can drive new fighting concepts or enhance existing workflows.

We identify operational challenges and develop bespoke solutions that enhance the efficiency, effectiveness, and security of our operations. Our team fosters a culture of creativity and close collaboration within the team and with our users. 

Through our unwavering commitment to nurturing digital talents and embracing diversity, we aim to forge a future where technology empowers our armed forces, ensuring a safer and more agile defence ecosystem.
