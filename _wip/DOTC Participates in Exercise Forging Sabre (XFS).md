<p>Exercise Forging Sabre is a biennial "Sense and Strike" military exercise
conducted by the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). Held at Mountain Home Air
Force Base in Idaho, USA, this exercise brought together a diverse array
of military assets, including fighter jets, helicopters, drones, and ground
forces, to test and refine integrated capabilities in a highly demanding
environment.This year’s exercise saw the Digital Ops Tech Centre (DOTC)
participating for the first time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DOTC worked with SAF Content Generation Hub (SCGH) to develop a digital
platform that helped to automatically ingest large volumes of media from
various sources, and allowed swift retrieval of required footage. This
tailored solution enabled rapid collaboration among units and accelerated
the development of media products for information operations, significantly
streamlining existing work processes.
<br>
<br>Eunice Lee, a Product Manager from DOTC that was deployed in-theatre shares
her experience:
<br>
<br><em>“DOTC worked with SCGH to digitalise and streamline their media workflow, which accelerated the creation of media products. To achieve this, we developed an operations-focused variant of Pinpoint, designed for high-volume and time-critical scenarios. The platform enabled rapid collaboration among SCGH and other units, ingested large volumes of media from multiple sources, automatically processed them, and allowed users to efficiently identify and retrieve relevant footage.</em>
</p>
<p><em>My role was to ensure the seamless integration of Pinpoint into their workflow, validate the new operational processes, and surface further improvement opportunities. I also worked closely with DOTC software engineers back in Singapore to implement rapid software updates in real time during the exercise.</em>
<br>
<br><em>The experience was eye-opening as it was my first participation in an exercise, which provided insights into operational dynamics and reinforced the importance of agility in high-tempo environments.”</em>
