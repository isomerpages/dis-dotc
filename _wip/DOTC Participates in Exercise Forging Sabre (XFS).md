<p>Exercise Forging Sabre is a biennial "Sense and Strike" military exercise
conducted by the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF). Held at Mountain Home Air
Force Base in Idaho, USA, this exercise brought together a diverse array
of military assets, including fighter jets, helicopters, drones, and ground
forces, to test and refine integrated capabilities in a highly demanding
environment.This year’s exercise saw the Digital Ops Tech Centre (DOTC)
participating in it for the first time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DOTC played a pivotal role in leveraging digital technology to enhance
operational efficiency and real-time decision-making during the exercise.
Collaborating with SAF Content Generation Hub (SCGH), DOTC helped digitalize
and streamline their media workflow, which was crucial in supporting the
exercise's extensive communications and media documentation needs.</p>
<p>To meet the demands of high-volume and time-critical scenarios typical
of Exercise Forging Sabre, DOTC developed an operations-focused variant
of its Pinpoint platform. This tailored solution enabled rapid collaboration
among units, ingesting large volumes of media from various sources, automating
processing tasks, and ensuring swift retrieval of relevant footage. Such
capabilities significantly accelerated the creation of media products,
allowing commanders and media teams to access timely and accurate situational
visuals.
<br>
<br>Eunice Lee, from DOTC, was tasked with ensuring the seamless integration
of Pinpoint into SCGH's workflow, validating operational processes, and
identifying areas for further improvement. Her direct involvement contributed
to optimizing media handling during the live exercise, exemplifying the
importance of adaptable digital solutions in complex scenarios. Additionally,
Eunice worked closely with DOTC software engineers in Singapore to implement
rapid software updates in real-time during the exercise, ensuring the platform
remained agile and responsive to evolving operational needs.
<br>
<br>This deployment marked Eunice’s first participation in an exercise of
this scale, providing invaluable insights into operational dynamics and
emphasizing the vital role of agility and technological innovation in high-tempo
environments.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>The experience underscored DOTC’s capability to deliver impactful digital
tools that bolster mission success and operational resilience in live,
demanding military exercises like Forging Sabre.</p>
