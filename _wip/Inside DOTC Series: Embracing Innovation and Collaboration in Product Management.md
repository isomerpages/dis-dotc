<p>At DOTC, we believe that great products are built through collaboration,
problem-solving, and a shared passion for innovation. In this series, we
spotlight the people behind our projects—sharing their insights, experiences,
and unique perspectives that drive our success.</p>
<p>We recently caught up with <strong>Joe Quak</strong>, a seasoned <strong>Product Manager</strong>,
to learn about his approach to balancing strategic vision with tactical
execution, fostering teamwork, and staying inspired in a fast-changing
environment. Much like navigating a complex maze, Joe’s approach combines
careful planning, adaptability, and a keen focus on the end goal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s a glimpse into Joe’s world and how he keeps everything moving forward
with purpose and passion.</p>

<blockquote>
<h3>How do you balance strategic vision with day-to-day tactical decisions&nbsp;when managing a product’s lifecycle?</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>
<br><em>"I don't think there is a fixed ratio for this, as you might be constantly zooming in and out depending on the current stage of the product's lifecycle. At the beginning, it’s important to have a vision in place — a rough idea of what the product is supposed to do — and it doesn’t need to be very refined initially. If the product isn’t in active development, there’s generally more focus on day-to-day tactical decisions to ensure we produce a working product that can be pushed out to the market. You then refer back to the vision to check if what you are doing aligns with the overall direction. When the product becomes more stable and gains some market share, there’s a need to shift focus more towards the vision and setting a roadmap for the future. During active development phases aimed at achieving the next milestone, you might switch back to more tactical decisions, always keeping the vision in mind and evaluating whether the current path is making enough progress. Balancing these aspects is challenging and involves constantly zooming in and out."</em>

<h3>Can you share a moment when you felt particularly proud of your impact as a product manager?</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>
<br><em>"I recall a time in the private sector working on the ZALORA post-purchase experience portfolio, where the customer service team faced ongoing challenges with customers calling in to cancel orders, since this wasn’t available as a self-serve option. After dedicating significant effort to designing, developing, and launching the functionality and user experience, the feature became easy for customers to adopt, which helped reduce the number of call-ins."</em>

<blockquote>
<h3>How do you foster collaboration between product designers and software engineers to ensure everyone is aligned?</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>
<br><em>"There are several approaches I use to promote collaboration. Rituals and structured routines within the team help facilitate communication. Over-communicating on updates and alignment points is also crucial. Deliberate planning for work meetings and workshops creates a space where ideas can flow freely and team members can collaborate effectively."</em>

<blockquote>
<h3>How do you ensure that user feedback is effectively integrated into your product roadmap?</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>
<br><em>"First, it’s necessary to have a systematic and disciplined approach to collecting feedback. There should be clear processes for reviewing feedback and extracting insights. These insights need to be fed into the roadmap, ideally using a flexible format that allows fluid inputs to be easily incorporated. Routine review sessions with the team help ensure that user feedback remains at the forefront of product planning and roadmap adjustments."</em>
<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Looking ahead, what emerging trends or technologies do you believe will significantly shape the future of product management?</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>
<br>"<em>Generative AI (GenAI) is already emerging as a helpful tool, although not everyone has fully adopted it yet. I’m still exploring ways to utilise it effectively. The ongoing trends in AI are likely to improve the tools available to us, which will help us do our jobs more efficiently and effectively."</em>

<blockquote>
<h3>How do you unwind after a particularly challenging project or week?</h3>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><em>"I spend time with my family — my wife and son — which helps me recharge. I also enjoy my hobbies, like playing puzzle games such as sudoku, because they provide instant gratification. Sometimes, I just need to relax and scroll through content online, which everyone needs from time to time."</em>
