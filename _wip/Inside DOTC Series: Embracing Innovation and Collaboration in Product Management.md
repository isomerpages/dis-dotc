<p>At DOTC, we believe that great products are built through collaboration,
problem-solving, and a shared passion for innovation. In this series, we
spotlight the people behind our projects—sharing their insights, experiences,
and unique perspectives that drive our success.</p>
<p>We recently caught up with <strong>Joe Quak</strong>, a seasoned <strong>Product Manager</strong>,
to learn about his approach to balancing strategic vision with tactical
execution, fostering teamwork, and staying inspired in a fast-changing
environment. Much like navigating a complex maze, Joe’s approach combines
careful planning, adaptability, and a keen focus on the end goal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s a glimpse into Joe’s world and how he keeps everything moving forward
with purpose and passion.</p>

<h3>How do you balance strategic vision with day-to-day tactical decisions&nbsp;when managing a product’s lifecycle?</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>
<br><em>"There isn’t a fixed ratio for how much time to spend on vision versus execution, as it shifts depending on the stage of the product lifecycle. At the start, it’s about defining the vision: a sense of what the product should do. This doesn’t need to be highly refined but serves as a guiding anchor. During active development, the focus turns to day-to-day decisions and problem-solving to deliver a working product to market. Even then, we regularly check back against the vision to ensure alignment with the overall direction. As the product stabilises and gains market share, attention shifts again to the bigger picture — refining the roadmap, anticipating challenges, and charting the path forward. The cycle repeats as products evolve, with the team constantly zooming in and out. Balancing these aspects is challenging but central to our culture: being agile, staying adaptable, and focused on building products that matter."</em>

<h3>Can you share a moment when you felt particularly proud of your impact as a product manager?</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>
<br><em>"I recall my time in the private sector working on the ZALORA post-purchase experience portfolio. One recurring challenge was the high volume of customer service calls from customers wanting to cancel their orders, since there wasn’t a self-serve option available on our shopping platforms. Our team invested in designing, developing, and launching a simple, intuitive cancellation feature. Adoption was quick, customers appreciated the convenience, and call volumes dropped significantly, and all without negatively affecting overall order numbers."</em>

<blockquote>
<h3>How do you foster collaboration between product designers and software engineers to ensure everyone is aligned?</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>
<br><em>"Collaboration is something we build deliberately. We have team rituals and structured routines that make communication natural and consistent. I also believe in sharing updates openly and aligning decisions early, so everyone feels informed and included. With thoughtful planning for meetings and workshops, we create spaces where ideas can flow freely and every team member has the opportunity to contribute. This helps us not only work better together but also build a culture of trust, openness, and shared ownership."</em>

<blockquote>
<h3>How do you ensure that user feedback is effectively integrated into your product roadmap?</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>
<br><em>"The first step is having a systematic and disciplined way of collecting feedback. Clear processes make it easier to review input and extract meaningful insights. These insights should then feed directly into the roadmap, ideally through a flexible format that allows new ideas to be incorporated smoothly. Regular review sessions with the team ensure user feedback stays at the heart of our product planning and guides how we adjust the roadmap over time."</em>
<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Looking ahead, what emerging trends or technologies do you believe will significantly shape the future of product management?</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>
<br><em>"Generative AI (GenAI) is already proving to be a useful tool, even though not everyone has fully adopted it yet. I’m still experimenting with how to use it most effectively in my work too. With the rapid pace of AI development, I believe the tools will only get better, helping us work more efficiently and opening up new ways to approach our challenges."</em>
<br>
</p>
<p></p>
<blockquote>
<h3>How do you unwind after a particularly challenging project or week?</h3>
</blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><em>"Outside of work, I recharge by spending time with my wife and son. I also enjoy hobbies like puzzle games, and sudoku is one of my favourites because they give me a quick sense of accomplishment. And like anyone else, sometimes I just switch off and relax by scrolling through content online."</em>
