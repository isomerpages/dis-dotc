<p>On 5 July, the DOTC team were given a rare opportunity to take to the
skies aboard the CH-47 Chinook helicopter, one of the aircraft featured
in the iconic National Day Parade (NDP) helicopter flypast formation. This
immersive experience gave the team valuable insights into the precision,
planning, and coordination that underpin such large-scale military operations.</p>

<h4><strong>Setting the Scene: Flying with Purpose</strong></h4>
<p>Before taking flight, the team was briefed by RSAF personnel on the operational
planning behind the flag and formation flypast. These briefings offered
a window into the rigorous preparations and safety protocols involved.</p>

<h4><strong>Taking Flight: On Board the CH-47</strong></h4>
<p>The highlight of the day was undoubtedly the flight aboard the CH-47 Chinook,
a heavy-lift helicopter known for its distinctive dual rotor system and
robust capabilities. Soaring through the sky in formation with other aircraft,
the DOTC team witnessed firsthand the seamless coordination required to
maintain formation flight. This flight wasnâ€™t just an interesting and fun
experience, it also deepened their appreciation for RSAF operations.</p>

<h4><strong>Reflections from the Team</strong></h4>
<p>The experience left a lasting impression. It reminded the team that behind
every operation lies a complex orchestration of training, coordination,
and trust. The experience will also provide the DOTC team with better context
when working with SAF units in developing digital solutions to enhance
the effectiveness and efficiency of operations.</p>
