<p>At the Digital Ops-Tech Centre (DOTC), we seek to work with ops users
to solve operational painpoints. That was why we developed Trackr - a high
performing and easy-to-use platform to track Heat Acclimatisation (HA)
activity currencies of our soldiers to improve training safety and enhance
work efficiency.

<p>Previously, manual tracking and spreadsheets were inefficient and prone
to errors in HA currency monitoring. Trackr addresses this by automating
tracking with real-time data inputs.</p>
<p>An intuitive dashboard clearly presents key information, giving unit commanders
immediate insights for timely, informed decisions. With real-time automation
and a user-friendly interface, Trackr eliminates delays and inaccuracies,
streamlining HA currency management and enhancing operational efficiency.</p>

<p>
<br>By centralising HA tracking data, Trackr makes it easy to share information
across units - eliminating isolated Excel files and enabling seamless collaboration.
This is especially valuable during personnel handovers, as incoming units
can quickly access up-to-date records, ensuring smooth transitions when
individuals are posted from one unit to another.</p>

<p>With Singpass login and a mobile-friendly interface, Trackr offers users
secure and convenient access—anytime, anywhere.
<br>
<br>The integration with Singpass ensures trusted, password-free authentication,
while the responsive design makes it easy to manage activities and track
HA currencies on-the-go, whether you're at your desk or out in the field.
<br>
<br>Overall, Trackr not only delivers quick and reliable insights, but also
reduces&nbsp;administrative workload for our ops units significantly. <strong>Trackr is already in active use&nbsp;by over 30 units</strong>,
helping track HA currency for <strong>more than 10,000 individuals</strong> across <strong>16,000 activities</strong> and <strong>830,000 attendance records</strong>.</p>
<p>And we’re just getting started. While HA tracking is our current focus, <strong>Trackr is built to support a growing range of currencies and metrics</strong> in
the near future, helping teams manage operational readiness across diverse
domains.</p>
