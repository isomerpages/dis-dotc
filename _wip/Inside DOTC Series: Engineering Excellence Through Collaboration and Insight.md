<p>Engineering is more than just code, it's about solving complex puzzles
and enhancing experiences through innovation. Our Software Engineering
team is dedicated to debugging challenges efficiently, empowering each
interaction with intelligence and clarity.
<br>
<br>To explore the realm of software engineering, we spoke with <strong>Vijeykannen Ng</strong>,
a <strong>software engineer</strong> in the Pinpoint team. With his extensive
experience, he shared his distinctive problem-solving approach and expressed
pride in his significant projects. Beyond coding, Vijey enjoys playing
Magic: The Gathering, a trading card game where strategy is crucial. He
applies the strategic thinking he develops from card games to his work.</p>
<h3><strong>What’s your go to strategy for debugging tough issues?</strong></h3>
<p><em>“When tackling tough issues, I often dive deep into the problem, meticulously exploring every line of code. However, I know when I’ve hit a wall. In those moments, I reach out to a colleague for help. As I describe the issue, something remarkable often happens—I experience a sudden burst of inspiration that leads me to the solution, sometimes even before I finish my question. This method is known as ‘rubber ducking,’ and it serves as a powerful reminder that articulating our thoughts can illuminate paths we didn’t see before."</em>

<h3><strong>If you had to choose a single programming language to master for the rest of your career, which would you pick?</strong><br></h3>
<p>"My journey started with C, a language that taught me the importance of
explicit design in programming. I find the intricacies of writing optimized,
low-level code fascinating. Did you know that Roller Coaster Tycoon was
crafted entirely by one person using Assembly? That's the level of mastery
I'm aspiring to achieve—capturing that mad genius essence in programming."</p>

<h3><strong>What project or feature do you look back on most proudly, and can you share the most rewarding feature you’ve built and the problem it solved?</strong></h3>
<p>“I’d have to say the video upload feature on Pinpoint stands out as my
proudest achievement and a true highlight. It was my first full-stack project
where I designed the implementation from frontend to backend, including
database management and cloud infrastructure. Before its launch, users
hesitated to engage with the platform, but post-launch, we witnessed significant
user growth. The challenges I faced taught me invaluable lessons throughout
the development process, and this transformation affirmed the necessity
of constant innovation in addressing user concerns.”<strong><br><br></strong>

<h3><strong>Which aspect of your daily work would you most like to automate or simplify?</strong></h3>
<p><em>"While many tasks are automated, issues arise when automation fails, especially if the system was built by someone else. This emphasizes the importance of understanding the original workings—hence, I prefer to tackle tasks manually at first. It gives me deeper insights into the underlying operations, making me better equipped for troubleshooting."</em>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<h3><strong>If your code could send you a thank-you note, what would it say?</strong></h3>
<p>"I imagine my code would tremble in awe, as I’m passionate about eliminating
unnecessary lines. It's all about the purity of code—less is more, and
I take pride in maintaining efficiency."</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<h3><strong>What’s one task or tool you’d love to see improved in your workflow?</strong><br><br></h3>
<p><em>“As Pinpoint has evolved, so has its complexity. I dream of enhancing our build scripts to streamline our app’s performance. A faster build process in our local development environment would significantly increase our efficiency and productivity."</em>
</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<h3><strong>As someone who enjoys playing card games, have you ever applied a similar strategic mindset in your engineering work?</strong></h3>
<p><em>"Playing Magic: The Gathering has taught me two crucial lessons: consistent strategies often lead to success, and understanding both your resources and opponents is key. I apply these principles in software engineering by prioritizing simplicity in our product design, using reputable tools, and focusing on features that deliver maximum impact. Just like a good player must adapt to the game, I believe in the importance of knowing our product and users deeply to develop optimal solutions."</em>
